- ‚úåüèº Hey there! My name is Ritvik Gautam, and I live in Tampa, FL! I'm interested in technology, like AI, operating systems, etc.! I'm currently working on SupeNux, an OS made on Linux technology, and Curl, a programming language that mainly uses curly ({}) brackets made on Python technology!
- Here's the link to SupeNux if you want to check it out! https://www.github.com/gautamritvik/SupeNux
- **BIG CURL UPDATE**: Curl is now officially in production! Curl is a lightweight (for now hehe üòà) programming language with medium complex syntax that can do basic functions, but is intended to have built-in AI functions and code blocks with other programming languages (languages targeted to be supported on Curl: Python, JavaScript, Java, C, C++, and (maybe) Node.js). It was made with Python 3.13 on a Windows Surface Pro 7 (tablet-laptop). Go to https://www.github.com/gautamritvik/Curl-Programming. Please support Curl, thanks!
- **HUGE SUPENUX UPDATE**: SupeNux is now officially available!!! It is a Raspberry Pi distro, and it works on the SD card port on the bottom of a Raspberry Pi. It only works on the terminal as of right now, but I'm trying to make some GUI for the operating system so it can display it's first screen pointer! Go to https://github.com/gautamritvik/SupeNux/blob/main/SupeNux-Raspberry-Pi.md to get the .img file and it also has further instructions to put it on a physical SD card. Please support SupeNux, thanks!
